# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

## Description

The Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to take turns and mark positions on a 3x3 grid. Player 1 is represented by 'O', and Player 2 is represented by 'X'. The players enter the position number where they want to place their respective marker ('O' or 'X'). The game checks for winning conditions after each move and declares the winner if any player successfully places three of their markers in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. If all positions are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the position number for your move.
3. The game will display the updated grid after each move.
4. Continue taking turns until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Example Grid

Here's a reference grid showing the position numbers:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 
```

## Getting Started

To run the Tic Tac Toe game, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Simply execute the Python script `tic_tac_toe.py` in your preferred Python environment.
